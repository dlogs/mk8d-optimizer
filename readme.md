## Weights

Terrain weights allow for a single stat that is the weighted average of the terrain-specific values

Diminishing returns allows for creating a more balanced cart by reducing the value of each additional point

## Stats Sources

"In Game" Stats are from the [Super Mario Wiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe#Drivers'_and_vehicle_parts'_statistics)
"Raw" Stats are from [Luigi_Fan2's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g7A-38tn9UAIbB2B3sZI-MpILsS3ZS870UTVMRRxh4Q/edit#gid=0)
